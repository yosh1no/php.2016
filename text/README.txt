Learning PHP 5
by David Sklar
ISBN: 0-596-00560-1

Each directory contains the numbered code examples for a particular
chapter or appendix in the book. The files are numbered sequentially
and match the example numbers in the book. Each directory also
contains an "index.txt" file that lists the numbers and titles of each
example in that directory.

The AppendixC directory contains the answers to exercises. Mostly,
there is one file per exercise answer. There are a few answers that
are split up into "a" and "b" files because the printed answer
consists of two PHP programs. Also, there are two answers for Chapter
10 that use specifically named auxiliary files, template.html and
addresses.txt. Those files are in the AppendixC directory, too.

In other directories, files are named example-X-YY.ZZZ, where "X" is
the chapter number or appendix letter, "YY" is the example number, and
"ZZZ" is the file extension. Almost all of the examples are PHP
scripts, so their extension is "php". Other file types have different
extensions as appropriate: html, sql, csv, txt, ini, and conf.

Please note that some of the example and exercise answer files have
PHP start and end tags (<?php and ?>) and some do not. The general
rule is that complete programs have the start/end tags, while
fragments do not. If you see start/end tags in a code example in the
book, then the corresponding file has them, too. If you don't see the
start/end tags in the book, then they're not in the file.
